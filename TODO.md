# TODO: Eliminate FOUC and Layout Shift

## Tasks to Complete
- [ ] Refactor responsive.css to mobile-first approach (base styles for mobile, min-width for larger screens)
- [ ] Inline critical above-the-fold CSS in index.html <head>
- [ ] Load responsive.css asynchronously using media="print" + onload
- [ ] Update font preload with font-display: swap
- [ ] Ensure images use responsive attributes (srcset, sizes) where applicable
- [ ] Verify JS does not affect initial layout (already deferred)
- [ ] Test for FOUC elimination
